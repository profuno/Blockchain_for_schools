# Project_Cicero

Project_Cicero aims to develop a curriculum and set of resources to help schools introduce the concepts of Blockchain (primarily Bitcoin and Ethereum) to their students, as well as educating the educators on the power and emerging importance of crypto assests. It is hoped that the curriculum is accessible to regular educators with an interest in technology and any forward thinking leaders in the field of education.

# Curriculum:
Project_Cicero aims to develop curriculum that can be used in schools to introduce the history, concepts and technical aspects of blockchain technology, initially focusing on Bitcoin and Ethereum. 


Examples of key points in blockchain history:

Bitcoin:
Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin White Paper, Segwit 2X

Ethereum:
Ethereum White Paper, DAO Hardfork, ICO Madness (2017)

Concepts / Readings:
History of Money, Smart Contracts - Nick Szabo (1994), The Internet of Money

# Practical use cases - Ethereum and Smart Contracts 
For teachers:

Project_Cicero would like to help teachers earn cryptocurrencies:
In order to help teachers understand the potential benefit of distributed and decentralised systems, Project_Cicero will build an educational marketplace for teaching resources on top of Ethereum to compete with the centralised TeachersPayTeachers. TeachersPayTeachers takes a cut of up to 45% of sales on its platform with total sales reported in 2014 of more than $30,000,000. 

For schools:

Project_Cicero would like to help schools put to use their idle computing power and physical resources:
Many schools have invested large sums of money in technology infrastructure. By proving advice to these schools on how to connect to emerging Web 3 technologies such as the Golem Project, Project_Cicero can help schools raise money to invest back into learning inititives.

Project_Cicero can also advise schools on how to enter the shared economy by renting out their unused spaces, such as their basketball courts, swimming poors, tennis courts or auditoriums through the use of something like the Etherium Computer.

For students:

Providing students with knowledge to build their own smart contract that acts as the voting mechanism for student elections is one example of how Project_Cicero will begin to link curriculum with practical applications. See link below as an example:
