P_C would like to develop a peer to peer marketplace for teaching and learning resources.

P_C would like to maximise the profits made by teachers on the resources they sell by removing centralised parties. The current online marketplace leader, TeachersPayTeachers (TPT), takes a cut of 45% on sales (there is also an annual subscription account - $60yr -  which takes a cut of 20%). The total amount of sales is unknown, but it is clear that TPT has made 100s of millions of dollars worth of sales made since its inception in 2006.

The complexity of this project can grow as blockchain ecosystem matures. 

It is possible to imagine that a series of smart contracts could also work in a way where school districts could incentivise teachers to develop the highest quality lesson plans or learning resources possible, and offering them for sale to their entire school district. The school in this way could potentially share in the teacher's profit, and the teacher could benefit from the school district acting as a 'certifying of quality content' to gain greater exposure.

With the above example, we can imagine that students would potentially benefit from such practice as their teachers would have access to the best resources possible. 


How to best handle P2P payments on the platform?

Project_Cicero would like to avoid running an ICO / Token Sale with an ERC20 token

There are a few reasons for this:

1. The best ICOs are ones that have a product already developed and as it stands this is nothing more than an idea of the P_C team.

2. ICOs are a bit gross a the moment. They look like money grabs. 

3. SEC / Legal Stuff 

4. Function - A common thread of discussion when it comes to projects in the space is why certain teams have chosen to utilise an ERC20 token as the method of value transaction as opposed to the native unit of Ether. Gnosis and Golem are two relatively mature products that come to mind as having their use of an ERC20 token called into question. Both teams seem to have good reason for using one, which can be found outlined in various AMAs on the platforms subreddits. However, not all projects seem to have valid uses for their ERC20 token as a means of payment and used it more as a tool for raising funds and perhaps building a community. This is not to say that these are illigitimate reasons, but it might be.


What are the other options?

One thing that has come out of the debate surrounding Vitalik Buterin's April 1st joke about limiting the supply of Ether to double that of the projects pre-mine was the value in having an inflationary currency. 

If Ether does turn the way of Bitcoin and become a coin with a fixed, known supply, does that mean using Ether as the native currency for a Dapp less practical? And does this mean that using an ERC20 token like GNT (Golem) or GNO (Gnosis) more practical? 

AirDrop
It is possible to airdrop tokens to teachers/resource creators who want to participate in the platform early on. These could be people who already participate in other ecosystems such as TeachersPayTeachers and TES online. There could be some creative ways for these people to prove their identity. 

Another way to ensure the airdrop is going to actual teachers is by using a similar method that Google or Microsoft use when providing educator discounts. Teachers register for the airdrop by providing their work(school) email address and the domain is checked.

Interface between Fiat and Ether/ERC20
P_C is on the lookout for open source projects that have found a way to hide the "crypto" in their crypto-based website. How can teachers deposit fiat and buy with fiat without worrying about all the cyprtoness? Yours.org has done this with their website and use of Bitcoin Cash.

It should be noted that one of the main goals of P_C is to introduce the value of cyrpto assests to educators, which will trickle down to their students. Therefore, it may not be wise to completely hide the "cryptoness" of the website and the interactions taking place. Teachers/users need to be aware that the reason there is such a small fee for using the site is thanks to the blockchain technology that is running in the background.
