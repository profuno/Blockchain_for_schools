How to best handle P2P payments on the platform?

Project_Cicero would like to avoid running an ICO / Token Sale 

There are a few reasons for this:

1. The best ICOs are ones that have a product already developed and as it stands P_C is nothing more than a few lose ideas.

2. ICOs look more like money grabs more than anything else.

3. SEC / Legal / Stuff

4. Fuction - A common thread in discussion when it comes to projects in the space is why certain teams have chosen to utlised an ERC20 token as the method of value trasaction as opposed to the native unit of Ether. Gnosis and Golem are two relatively mature products that come to mind as having their use of an ERC20 token called into question. And both teams seem to have good reason for using one. However, not all projects seem to have valid uses for their ERC20 token as a means of payment and used it more as a tool for raising funds and perhaps building a community.


What are the other options?

One thing that has come out of the debate surrounding VB April 1st joke about limiting the supply of Ether to double that of the projects pre-mine was the value in having an inflationary currency. 

If Ether does turn the way of Bitcoin and become a coin with a fixed, known supply, does that mean using Ether as the native currency for an Dapp less practical? And does this mean that using an ERC20 token like GNT (Golem) or GNO (Gnosis) more practical.
