One of the ideas that P_C would like to develop is a peer to peer marketplace for teachers to exchange teaching and learning resources.

P_C would like to maximise the profits made by teachers on the resources they sell by having the smallest transaction fee possible. Even if this fee was 5% of the profits going towards the platform, this would be a 10 fold increase on other popular options on the market today. 

It is possible to imagine that a series of smart contracts could also work in a way where school districts could incentivise teachers to develop the higest quality lesson plans or learning resources possible, and offering them for sale to their entire school district. The school in this way could potentially share in the teachers profit and the teacher could benefit from the school district acting as a 'certifying of quality content' to gain greater exposure.

With the above example, we can imagine that students would potentially benefit from such practice as their teachers would have access to the best resources possible. 


How to best handle P2P payments on the platform?

Project_Cicero would like to avoid running an ICO / Token Sale with an ERC20 token

There are a few reasons for this:

1. The best ICOs are ones that have a product already developed and as it stands this is nothing more than an idea of the P_C team.

2. ICOs are a bit gross a the moment. They look like money grabs. 

3. SEC / Legal Stuff 

4. Fuction - A common thread in discussion when it comes to projects in the space is why certain teams have chosen to utilise an ERC20 token as the method of value trasaction as opposed to the native unit of Ether. Gnosis and Golem are two relatively mature products that come to mind as having their use of an ERC20 token called into question. Both teams seem to have good reason for using one, which can be found outlined in varous AMAs on the platforms subreddits. However, not all projects seem to have valid uses for their ERC20 token as a means of payment and used it more as a tool for raising funds and perhaps building a community. This is not to say that these are illigitimate reasons, but it might be.


What are the other options?

One thing that has come out of the debate surrounding Vitalik Buterin's April 1st joke about limiting the supply of Ether to double that of the projects pre-mine was the value in having an inflationary currency. 

If Ether does turn the way of Bitcoin and become a coin with a fixed, known supply, does that mean using Ether as the native currency for an Dapp less practical? And does this mean that using an ERC20 token like GNT (Golem) or GNO (Gnosis) more practical. 

AirDrop
It is possible to air drop tokens to teachers/resource creators who want to particpate in the platform early on. These could be people who already participate in other ecosystems such as TeachersPayTeachers and TES online. There could be some creative ways for these people to prove their ideintity. 

Another way to ensure the airdrop is going to actual teachers is by using a similar method that Google or Microsoft use when providing educator discounts. Teachers register for the airdrop by providing their work(school) email address and the domain is checked.

Interface between Fiat and Ether/ERC20
P_C is on the look out for open source projects that have found a way to hide the "crypto" in their crypto based website. How can teachers deposit fiat and buy with fiat without worrying about all the cyprtoness? Yours.org has done this with their website and use of Bitcoin Cash.

It should be noted that one of the main goals of P_C is to introduce the value of cyrpto assests to educators, which will trickle down to their students. Therefore, it may not be wise to completly hide the "cryptoness" of the website and the interactions taking palce. Teachers/users need to be aware that the reason there is such a small fee for using the site is thanks to the blockchain technology that is running in the background.
